If you're having issues using one of the repositories or want to discuss topics related to it, feel free to look through the existing issues and discussions for each repository and add new ones if your problem is different. We'll try to get back to you soon to help you with your problem. If you'd like to contribute to a repository, check out GitHub's guide to [project contributions](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects). The same principles apply to suggesting and incorporating changes into our public repositories.

We subscribe to the principle of open-sourcing from the start. This allows for early and iterative community feedback as well as letting others know what we're interested in and what we're working on. As a result, some repositories will be a work-in-progress (WIP). These are some of the best ones to collaborate on! Where appropriate, we are also exploring consolidating repositories and porting functionality into larger "hub" repositories like [pymatgen](https://pymatgen.org/).
